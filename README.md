### Coffee Store Sales Analysis for Maven Company | Excel 

## Key Objectives 
1. Analyse revenue trends by month for each store.
2. Number of transactions by weekday and hours for each store.
3. Top 5 product across all stores.

## Data Collection

Data obtained from Maven Company's website. Downloaded an excel file containing sales data for each store.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
1. Some columns data had unnecessary space and improper spellings. Formatted them with trim and proper functions. 
2. Created a revenue column based on sales quantities and prices.
3. Converted the date column into separate columns for year, weekday, and hour to facilitate analysis.
4. Created multiple pivot tables and pivot charts to analyse the data.

## Findings
1. All 3 stores have started with revenue of 𝐚𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 £𝟐𝟕𝐊 and by June they revenue 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 £𝟓𝟓𝐊. The store in 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐥’𝐬 𝐊𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐧 made the highest revenue which is £56,957.
2. For 𝐀𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚, Monday and Thursday made the most transactions. However, 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬, transactions went low by about 400. Hell’s Kitchen had a similar trend except they made most transections on Tuesday and Friday. Manhattan made the most transactions only on Mondays and 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐬𝐚𝐰 𝐚 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬.
3. All stores made most of the transactions 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝟔:𝟎𝟎 𝐭𝐨 𝟏𝟎:𝟎𝟎. The transactions were very low in Hell’s Kitchen and Manhattan in the last two hours.
4. In all 3 stores, 𝐁𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐚 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢 was the item making the most revenue. Brewed Chai tea came at the second place. The other products were Hot Chocolate, Gourmet Brewed tea and herbal tea.

## Recommendations
1. Given that the transactions were very low in Hell’s Kitchen and Manhattan in the last two hours, they might close earlier to cut business hours to reduce business cost.
2. As Manhattan saw a decline in transactions other than Monday, they should focus marketing efforts and promotions on weekdays to increase transactions outside of Mondays. Consider introducing weekday-specific offers and adjusting operational hours to optimize sales distribution throughout the week.
